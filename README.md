# PersonalFreeCDN
A free image hosting repository for my personal use that will use JSDeliver for CDN functionality and Github as the primary source of truth.

## Directions:
### Step 1: Set up the repository

1. Create a public GitHub repository (e.g., my-image-cdn)
2. Upload your images to organized folders like /images/, /assets/, etc.
3. Commit and push to the main branch

### Step 2: Find the image permalink on github

### Step 3: Access via JSDelivr
Paste your image permalink in JSDeliver here.

https://www.jsdelivr.com/github


### Step 4: (Optional) Shorten the URL with a URL shortener.
https://tinyurl.com/


Your should now have a URL to your image that you can use to display anywhere. This also works with static assets like JS files as well.

### Benefits:

1. Global CDN with edge caching
2. No setup required
3. Supports version pinning with tags/commits
4. Fast and reliable
5. Images are stored on github so you dont use your personal storage like google photos.
